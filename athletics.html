    <h1 align="center"> Athletics</h1>
    
    <p align="center"> Throughout high school, I participated in many sports. Freshman year, I started off with cross country to stay in shape for my other sports. One of the worst decisions I have ever made, too much running for me. I also played basketball and lacrosse. Sophomore year, I played golf in the fall which I enjoyed much more. I continued to play these three sports for the rest of high school. I did not get along with my basketball coach, so I decided to play recreationally for junior and senior year. My lacrosse coach was the best coach I've ever had, and I really enjoyed playing for him all four years. Overall, I really enjoyed high school athletics. It was just a bummer that I did not get to play basketball for the school my last two years, because it is my favorite sport.</P>
