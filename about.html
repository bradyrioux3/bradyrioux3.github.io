     <h2 align="center"> Where I'm From </h2>
<p>My name is Brady Rioux. I have lived in Maine all of my life. My first house was in North Yarmouth, where I lived for two years before moving to Gorham, Maine. I have lived in two different houses in Gorham. I am still currently living in the second one with my parents and my brother and sister.</p>

     <h2 align="center"> Interests </h2>
<p>I have many interests. These involve music, sports, foods, partying, etc. I enjoy all types of music, except for country. My favorite type of music is rap, and my favorite artist is Travi$ Scott. I love to play sports. I pretty much enjoy anything. Basketball, football, and lacrosse are my favorites. However, I love to watch hockey as well as the other three. My favorite foods to have are donuts and lobster. I love to go out with my friends. I watch a lot of different t.v shows, from American Ninja Warrior to South Park.</p>

     <h2 align="center"> School </h2>
<p>I attended Gorham High School for four years, and graduated in 2017. I enjoyed my time there. Along the way, I met many great teachers and friends. I played on a various amount of sports teams, and got close to a lot of my teammates. I looked at a lot of schools for college, and ultimately decided it was best for me to choose the University of Maine at Orono. It was the cheapest and closest, and I already know lots of people here.</p>
